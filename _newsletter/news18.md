* Paul recently bought an M4 Mac Mini and if you're having WiFi issues and have an external hard drive, [check out this article](https://appleinsider.com/inside/mac-mini/tips/how-to-fix-weak-wi-fi-on-a-m4-mac-mini-when-connected-to-a-drive-or-dock)
* Tod wondered in the last episode if there was a way for you to record your own vinyl records.  Sure enough, back in the day, was the [VoiceOGrpah](https://voiceograph.com/history-of-voice-o-graph).
* Paul played a lot of Comand and Conquer twenty-some years ago so it's exciting to see * [EA open source Command and Conquer](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/ea-just-open-sourced-command-conquer-red-alert-renegade-and-generals/).
* Espressif now supports [Rust on the ESP32](https://hackaday.com/2025/02/27/esp-hal-a-stable-api-esp32-hal-gift-for-your-rust-code/).
* Paul loves everything vinyl records, but a [turntable watch](https://www.theverge.com/news/627130/ando-vinyl-record-automatic-watch-panasonic-technics-sl-1200-turntable) might be pushing it.
* The spirit of RadioFreeFedi lives on at the artist directory of the [https://indieart.support](Independent Artist Support Community). And listen to The [IndieBeat Radio](https://theindiebeat.fm) to hear your favorite Fedi artists or if you use Linux and GNOME, Andy Piper created an [extension for The IndieBeat Radio](https://andypiper.co.uk/2025/01/25/the-indie-beat-on-your-linux-desktop/).
* Looking for another browser-based daily game? Try [Bracket City](https://bracket.city/)!  Tod's terrible at it but keeps trying. üòÅ
* Lilygo, maker of cool maker-oriented dev boards, the new [T5 E-Paper S3 Pro](https://lilygo.cc/products/t5-e-paper-s3-pro) has an ESP32-S3 (native USB!), 960x540 ePaper display, touchscreeen, battery, LoRA, & RTC. [(github docs)](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T5S3-4.7-e-paper-PRO)
* Back in [The Bootloader S02:E09](https://www.thebootloader.net/blog/2024/06/03/beautiful-bezier-curves/), Tod talked about the M5Stack Cardputer, a tiny calculator-like ESP32-based pocket computer. [They've updated it to be slightly bigger (yay bigger buttons!) and better battery life](https://www.hackster.io/news/m5stack-revisits-the-cardputer-launches-a-new-model-with-better-keyboard-and-battery-life-15f15e0de535). Still $30, still ESP32-S3.
* Shawn Hymel just started a great video & blog series for Digikey about [Zephyr](https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/tutorials/2025/introduction-to-zephyr-part-1-getting-started-installation-and-blink). The most recent one dives into [CMake](https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/tutorials/2025/introduction-to-zephyr-part-2-cmake-tutorial) and Tod really enjoyed it, since CMake is so prevalent now. Especially the links at the bottom, like [Modern CMake](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/README.html).

## From the hosts

### Paul

**What I'm working on:** New episodes of [The CircuitPython Show](https://www.circuitpythonshow.com/@circuitpythonshow) have been coming out steadily and have been keeping me busy editing and publishing. I did just order my first rp2350 board, so I might have an update next month.

**What I'm watching:** When I'm not watching college basketball (On Wisconsin!), I re-watched Severance season 1 as it had been three years and going into season 2, I'm glad I did. I also enjoyed Landman with Billy Bob Thornton - I enjoy watching him on the small screen.  I also treated myself to a one year subscription to The Criterion Collection for my birthday and I've been catching up on classic movies from the 40s and 50s to the early 2000s.  In no particular order I've enjoyed Alfred Hitchcock's North By Northwest, Moonstruck, Thief, Crossing Delancey and Down With Love.

### Tod

**What I'm working on:**

Still cleaning up a bit after the Pasadena fires. [I got to be on the CircuitPython Show](https://www.circuitpythonshow.com/@circuitpythonshow/episodes/writing-a-circuitpython-library-for-the-community-bundle) with ["CedarGrove"](https://github.com/CedarGroveStudios?tab=repositories) talking about adding libraries to the Community Bundle. It was fun!

**What I'm watching:** In additition to Severance, obviously, I've really been enjoying "Only Murders in the Building". Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez live in an amazing Manhattan apartment building, solving a murder by way of a true-crime podcast. It's a bonkers premise but really fun. Also, [Hank Green's vlog on the moons of Jupiter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grdu6UBK76w) is incredible.
