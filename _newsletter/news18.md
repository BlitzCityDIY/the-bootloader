* Paul recently bought an M4 Mac Mini and if you're having WiFi issues and have an external hard drive, [check out this article](https://appleinsider.com/inside/mac-mini/tips/how-to-fix-weak-wi-fi-on-a-m4-mac-mini-when-connected-to-a-drive-or-dock)
* Tod wondered in the last episode if there was a way for you to record your own vinyl records.  Sure enough, back in the day, was the [VoiceOGrpah](https://voiceograph.com/history-of-voice-o-graph).
* Paul played a lot of Comand and Conquer twenty-some years ago so it's exciting to see * [EA open source Command and Conquer](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/ea-just-open-sourced-command-conquer-red-alert-renegade-and-generals/).
* Espressif now supports [Rust on the ESP32](https://hackaday.com/2025/02/27/esp-hal-a-stable-api-esp32-hal-gift-for-your-rust-code/).
* Paul loves everything vinyl records, but a [turntable watch](https://www.theverge.com/news/627130/ando-vinyl-record-automatic-watch-panasonic-technics-sl-1200-turntable) might be pushing it.

## From the hosts

### Paul

**What I'm working on:** New episodes of [The CircuitPython Show](https://www.circuitpythonshow.com/@circuitpythonshow) have been coming out steadily and have been keeping me bush editing and publishing. I did just order my first rp2350 board, so I might have an update next month.

**What I'm watching:** When I'm not watching college basketball (On Wisconsin!), I re-watched Severance season 1 as it had been three years and going into season 2, I'm glad I did. I also enjoyed Landman with Billy Bob Thornton - I enjoy watching him on the small screen.  I also treated myself to a one year subscription to The Criterion Collection for my birthday and I've been catching up on classic movies from the 40s and 50s to the early 2000s.  In no particular order I've enjoyed Alfred Hitchcock's North By Northwest, Moonstruck, Thief, Crossing Delancey and Down With Love.
