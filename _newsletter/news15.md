# Welcome

Happy Holidays from The Bootloader! It's hard to believe it's December already and another year has passed by.  With the Thanksgiving holiday in the US over just a few weeks ago we wanted to say how thankful we are for having you as listeners.  

We're now on Bluesky!  If you're not on Mastodon, we'll also post updates on Bluesky.

## Show Highlights

The latest episode was all about [Hackaday's Supercon](https://hackaday.io/superconference/), which Tod has been going to for the past seven years.  We talked about the Supercon badge, add-ons for the badge, and shared some of our favorite talks by a variety of makers.  You can find some of the talks on Hackaday's YouTube channel:

* [Giving Robotic Friends a Voice: Jorvon Moss & Shawn Hymel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uitqFyHD-QQ)
* [Solving the Last Mile With 3D-printed Packaging: Christina Cyr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC1JbWsBb1M)

And if you just watch one video from Supercon, make it this one:

* [Microcontrollers Are Just Radios in Disguise - Charles Lohr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V57f5YltIwk)

Here's a picture of Tod's Supercon 2024 badge with a few simple add-ons attached:

## Leftover Links

Here's a few links that we wanted to highlight that didn't make it into the show because of our Supercon coverage:

* Back in October, Paul talked about Steph Piper's Maker Skill Trees.  The [book is now for sale](https://www.makershed.com/collections/all/products/make-skillseeker-workbook) - check it out!
* Speaking of Supercon, Chris Wilson shared on his blog what it was like [going to Supercon for the first time](https://cdwilson.dev/articles/hackaday-supercon-2024/).
* Paul is not embarrassed by his love of the BeeGees and [this video of an integrated circuit chip walking to Stayin' Alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDhNQPt8An0) had him laughing out loud.
* Victoria Korhonen [has created the world's smallest arcade machine](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/it-s-not-yet-official-but-this-is-the-world-s-smallest-arcade-machine-guess-what-game-it-plays-1.7406570).  It plays pong and measures approximately 64 mm tall, 26 mm wide and 30 mm deep.  (Via [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2024/12/11/tiny-pong-big-ambitions-worlds-smallest-arcade/))

## What We're Up To

### Paul

**What I'm watching:** I haven't been up to much as I've been recovering from a successful surgical procedure.  It has given me plenty of time to binge a few shows and catch up on a few movies.

* Tulsa King: Sylvester Stallone, in his first television role, stars as a New York mobster just released from prison after twenty five years.  He's banished by his mob family to Tulsa, where he has to start over. 
* What We Do in the Shadows: This show just wrapped up its sixth and final season.  This mockumentary focuses on four vampires and their familiar who live in Long Island and is laugh out loud funny.
* The Wild Robot: Yes, it's an animated movie.  Yes, you should go see it.
