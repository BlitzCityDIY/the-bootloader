## From the hosts

### Paul

**What I'm working on:** I shared [earlier this month](https://buttondown.com/circuitpythonshow/archive/the-return-of-the-circuitpython-show/) that I was bringing back [The CircuitPython Show](https://www.circuitpythonshow.com/@circuitpythonshow) after a one year hiatus.  I've been hard at work recording and editing episodes and am happy to say that the first episode debuted January 13th with CircuitPython community member Aaron Pendley.  I'm mixing it up this season with topic based episodes in addition to community interviews.

**What I'm watching:** Like Tod last month, I've been watching the latest Star Wars show, Skeleton Crew.  I'm also enjoying The Day of the Jackal on Peacock.
