# Welcome
Welcome and thanks for listening to The Bootloader.  We've got some behind the 
scenes news, a short recap of the latest episode, and what Tod and Paul are up to.

## Show Highlights

It was great having Kevin Santo Cappuccio on the show.  The Jumperless is something I've
been following for months and it was great to have a chance to talk to Kevin about it. 
He also shared the Arduino Uno Plus+ and evolvable computing, Tod shared Quake running on a
SparkFun Matter board and a new synth class and tool for a workshop at the Chicago 
makerspace, Pumping Station One, and Paul shared Manyfold, a Fediverse file sharing 
and management web app for 3D printing and a now cancelled Kickstarter.

## Behind the Scenes

There was a small bit of panic in preparing the show.  We use Streamyard to record the
audio and I (Paul) get a separate track for each speaker.  But this episode, the 
recording for my voice never finished processing.  At this point I had two single 
tracks and one blended MP3 track that would have been extremely difficult to edit. 
Streamyard's documentation and support wasn't any help, but I eventually found a 
buried setting in an alternate view of my content that let me re-process the upload 
and the recording was saved. Disaster averted!

## Leftover Links

A few things we found interesting that didn't make it into the show:

* Les Pounder of Tom's Hardware [announced MakerAdvent 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlDkDOHgG38). 
Each day of Advent starting December 1st, a new video is posted with a small activity for 
makers of all levels.
* Arduino released a [browser based web app for its MicroPython Editor](https://www.hackster.io/news/arduino-brings-its-micropython-editor-to-the-cloud-with-a-browser-based-web-app-release-310179492abc).

## From the hosts

### Paul
**What I'm working on**: I got my start in contributing to open source projects by 
writing documentation.  Every once in a while I'll get the itch and come across a 
project that needs help with their documentation and I'll lend a hand.  I've spent 
the last few weeks [writing a user guide for Castopod](https://docs.castopod.org/main/en/user-guide/), 
the Fediverse connected open source podcasting platform that I use for my podcasts.
What's even better is that it was merged in just days after I sent in the pull request.

**What I'm watching**: Agatha All Along on Disney+.  It really worked for me, right 
up until it didn't.  I thought the show was delightful with its mystery and callbacks, 
but the finale episode left me wanting. 

### Tod


## Coming Next Episode
Tod is back from Supercon 2024 and Paul peppers him with questions.
