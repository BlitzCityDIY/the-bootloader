# Welcome
Welcome and thanks for listening to The Bootloader.  We've got some behind the
scenes news, a short recap of the latest episode, and what Tod and Paul are up to.

## Show Highlights

It was great having Kevin Santo Cappuccio on the show.  The Jumperless is something I've
been following for months and it was great to have a chance to talk to Kevin about it.
He also shared the Arduino Uno Plus+ and evolvable computing, Tod shared Quake running on a
SparkFun Matter board and a new synth class and tool for a workshop at the Chicago
makerspace, Pumping Station One, and Paul shared Manyfold, a Fediverse file sharing
and management web app for 3D printing and a now cancelled Kickstarter.

## Behind the Scenes

There was a small bit of panic in preparing the show.  We use Streamyard to record the
audio and I (Paul) get a separate track for each speaker.  But this episode, the
recording for my voice never finished processing.  At this point I had two single
tracks and one blended MP3 track that would have been extremely difficult to edit.
Streamyard's documentation and support wasn't any help, but I eventually found a
buried setting in an alternate view of my content that let me re-process the upload
and the recording was saved. Disaster averted!

A few things we found interesting that didn't make it into the show:

* Les Pounder of Tom's Hardware [announced MakerAdvent 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlDkDOHgG38).
Each day of Advent starting December 1st, a new video is posted with a small activity for
makers of all levels.
* Arduino released a [browser based web app for its MicroPython Editor](https://www.hackster.io/news/arduino-brings-its-micropython-editor-to-the-cloud-with-a-browser-based-web-app-release-310179492abc).
* [Touchscreens are Out, and Tactile Controls are Back](https://spectrum.ieee.org/touchscreens).
* [BBC Sound Effects archive, free for non-commercial use](https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk) – some of the best recorded sounds from all over.
* [HOME - Resonance but on MeowSynth](https://youtu.be/oq7aGYmxUvw?si=fXL3PyTwk6O8UmdP) – The synthwave/chillwave track ["HOME - Resonance"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GW6sLrK40k) is one of my (Tod's) favorites. And I just learned of a version done entirely with [MeowSynth](https://www.kvraudio.com/product/meowsynth_by_knobster/details)!


## From the hosts

### Paul
**What I'm working on**: I got my start in contributing to open source projects by
writing documentation.  Every once in a while I'll get the itch and come across a
project that needs help with their documentation and I'll lend a hand.  I've spent
the last few weeks [writing a user guide for Castopod](https://docs.castopod.org/main/en/user-guide/),
the Fediverse connected open source podcasting platform that I use for my podcasts.
What's even better is that it was merged in just days after I sent in the pull request.

**What I'm watching**: Agatha All Along on Disney+.  It really worked for me, right
up until it didn't.  I thought the show was delightful with its mystery and callbacks,
but the finale episode left me wanting.

### Tod
**What I'm working on**: With the destruction of Twitter, I'm going through my (now deleted) Twitter account, looking for CircuitPython / Arduino / synth hacks I only blogged about on Twitter from between 2020-2022. I'm updating them where appropriate and posting them on Mastodon and Github gist. The latest: a [simple physics system in CircuitPython](https://gist.github.com/todbot/d216cdfd0c13774c713482395429da16). And even though it's difficult to work through all the disillusionment of last week, I've been getting back in to KiCad and getting my ["eight_by"](https://github.com/todbot/eight_by) (8-pots/8-buttons/8-LEDs) board finished up.

**What I'm watching** Also Agatha All Along. As Paul mentioned, it was pretty great over all but definitely needs another season. Alongside that we've been re-watching [Killjoys](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3952222/). It's a lot of fun. Sci-fi, sorta like Firefly, with great characters, crazy situations, yet still pretty grounded. It's comfort food, in a way.

## Coming Next Episode
Tod is back from Supercon 2024 and Paul peppers him with questions.
