[InvenTree](https://inventree.org) (Paul #1)

Back in [Episode 17](ep017.md) I share [Inventory](https://github.com/dunkelstern/inventory), an open source inventory system for makers and manufacturers that had just released their 1.0 release.

Thanks to Alec Delaney (aka Tekktrik), I came across an app called [InvenTree](https://inventree.org), a play on the word Inventory, which also just released their 1.0 release after 8 years of active development.

Inventree includes a number of features, including:

* Organize your parts and sort them into different categories for your parts
* You can manage suppliers related to each part
* Stock locations, which are real world physical location for your parts
* Bill of material management, allowing you to define a list of parts to make an assembly
* Custom reports about your inventory based on a number of templates and it uses HTML templates to create PDF reports for you

Inventree also includes a robust [plugin ecosystem](https://inventree.org/extend/plugin/).  There are plugins maintainted by the core team as well as the community. There are plugins for just about everything - there’s integration for Digikey and Mouser, there’s a plugin to locate your physical stock locations with WLED, which is pretty neat, and a bunch of plugins to use with your printer.

Inventree is written in Python using the Django web framework and plugins can be written in Python, too.

There’s also excellent documentation covering everything you might want to know.  It’s detailed and covers all of the features.  And lastly, if you want to take Inventree for a spin before installing it, they have a full featured demo instance.  I logged in and tried it out and I came away really impressed.

[Channels DVR](https://getchannels.com) (Paul #2)

This next one is one of my favorite pieces of tech in my house and it just keeps getting better.  I cut the cord and got rid of cable TV probably close to fifteen years ago.  I’ve tried a number of solutions over the years since then for watching live TV with an antenna, including MythTV, Kodi and Emby, but there is one piece of software that I think does it better than any of them, and that’s an app called Channels.

First, you’ll need an antenna to get over the air stations that you hook up to a device called the HD HomeRun, which is a digital network tuner.  You plug the antenna into that, and the TV signal is now available over your network.  Antenna prices vary, and an HD HomeRun box will run you about $100 - $150 depending on which model you choose.  If you visit RabbitEars.info, it will show you a list of all the channels in your area that you can get via antenna - and you’ll probably be surprised how many channels there are.

Next, you’ll need to subscribe to Channels for $80 a year, which is $10 more a year than Plex.  Then you [download the Channels DVR server software,](https://getchannels.com/dvr-server/#dvr-install) which is available for Windows, Mac, Linux, Docker, and a number of network attached storage devices, including Synology, Netgear, TrueNAS and a lot more.

You can watch Channels on your TV using an AppleTV, Android TV, or an Amazon Fire Stick. The apps to connect to Channels and watch it on your phone or tablet on iOS or Android are all free.  And they make it super easy to watch it on the go away from home and just stream it over the internet to your device.

But it’s not just a DVR - you can manage all of your personal media on it as well.  I have a large physical media, with a ton of DVDs and Blu-Rays I’ve ripped, and I’ve imported them all into Channels.

Channels continues to innovate:
* Virtual Channels
* Multiview
* Skip intros and credits

There may be cheaper solutions out there for your DVR, but few are as polished as Channels.  I’ve been using it for years and it’s one of my favorite apps that I use.
