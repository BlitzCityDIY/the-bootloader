Back in [Episode 17](ep017.md) I share [Inventory](https://github.com/dunkelstern/inventory), an open source inventory system for makers and manufacturers that had just released their 1.0 release.

Thanks to Alec Delaney (aka Tekktrik), I came across an app called [InvenTree](https://inventree.org), a play on the word Inventory, which also just released their 1.0 release after 8 years of active development.

Inventree includes a number of features, including:

* Organize your parts and sort them into different categories for your parts
* You can manage suppliers related to each part
* Stock locations, which are real world physical location for your parts
* Bill of material management, allowing you to define a list of parts to make an assembly
* Custom reports about your inventory based on a number of templates and it uses HTML templates to create PDF reports for you

Inventree also includes a robust [plugin ecosystem](https://inventree.org/extend/plugin/).  There are plugins maintainted by the core team as well as the community. There are plugins for just about everything - there’s integration for Digikey and Mouser, there’s a plugin to locate your physical stock locations with WLED, which is pretty neat, and a bunch of plugins to use with your printer.

Inventree is written in Python using the Django web framework and plugins can be written in Python, too.

There’s also excellent documentation covering everything you might want to know.  It’s detailed and covers all of the features.  And lastly, if you want to take Inventree for a spin before installing it, they have a full featured demo instance.  I logged in and tried it out and I came away really impressed.
