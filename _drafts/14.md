### The UNO Plus+ (Kevin #1)


The [UNO Plus+](https://hackaday.io/project/189785-uno-plus) from John Loeffler is what the Arduino UNO should've been all along. It's the same shape and hardware as the Arduino UNO, with the added bonus of LEDs on every pin to show you the state.

I like shoveling a bunch of decorative LEDs onto things as much as the next guy, but I think when you're actually using them to convey information while still looking nice, it's 1000 times cooler. 

The whole "is this pin actually doing what I think it should be doing?" thing while debugging is sooo common. I really thought it would become less of an issue as I gained experience, but I'm pretty sure it happens to me even *more* now. 

If John could code, and was just using another microcontroller and addressables, I wouldn't trust this thing as far as I could throw it. But luckily, he can't. So he did the whole thing with *ton* of LM339 comparitors, and I'll trust the hell out of those. [They came out in the 70s, so I'd grant them honorary 7400 series status as far as chips go.] If that LED is on, I'd be as sure as I am of anything that the pin is high.

Another cool thing he did was to make the plastic header shrouds out of clear plastic with opaque separators to act as a light pipe. So it's not like an LED next to a pin lighting up, **the pin itself** is. It's a weird way to put it, but it kinda feels "immersive"?, like the pin lighting up is also what makes the signal go high.

And taking advantage of how cheap full color PCBs have gotten, along with the huge surface area of an Arduino UNO, he actually puts the full pin reference on the board, like the one you'd find on the internet with the alternate functions for all the pins and stuff. I have no idea why Arduino didn't do that originally, but then again, the Unos' pin headers are misaligned by twentieth of an inch so what should we expect.



### Manyfold (Paul #1)

[Manyfold](https://manyfold.app) is a self-hosted solution to organize and share your files for 3D
printing.  It's also connected to the Fediverse, allowing you to follow instances (aka server) or
creators.  You can run it in single-user mode or multi-user.  You can also make files public or private,
which is great for saving models you might have paid for but don't or can't share publicly.

* [Suported file formats](https://manyfold.app/manual/supported_formats.html) include 3MF, Blender,
FreeCAD, OpenSCAD, STEP, STL, OBJ, GCode, BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG, SVG, and even video files in MP4 or MPEG.
It also support Markdown, PDF, and text files.

### Quake on a SparkFun Thing Plus Matter board (Tod #1)

[next-hack.com got Quake running on a Feather-sized board](https://next-hack.com/index.php/2024/09/22/quake-port-to-sparkfun-and-arduino-nano-matter-boards-using-only-276-kb-ram/)

We've all seen the "Doom ported to *insert tiny electronics here*". Those are all
good hacks. Doom's game engine isn't real 3D though, more like 2.5D:
the enemies are 2D sprites and level geometry is perturbations of a 2D plane.
But the game Quake, id software's follow-up effort, was real 3D:
fully-polygonal monsters and game world.
Real 3D can be tough, so I figured it'd be awhile before we saw a port of Quake to tiny microcontrollers.

And yet, the folks at nexxt-hack.com have Quake running on a SparkFun Thing Plus Matter board.
This board is in the Feather format (0.9" x 2") and sports a MGM240P wireless module
for doing Bluetooth and Matter wireless protocols. This module also sports a EFR32MG24 chip,
which is a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M33 processor at 39 MHz, 1.5MB flash and 256 kB of RAM.
(This is essentially the same specs as the new RP2350 from RasPi, so maybe we'll see Quake on an
Adafruit Feather soon?)

After proving the idea using the SparkFun board, they designed a complete Quake-playing
gamepad with built-in screen, joysticks, sound, and battery.
This time using the Arduino Nano Matter board (which has a similar MGM240-series module on it)
You can also run their port of Doom on it. :-)  Of course, you can download the schematic,
board files, and bill-of-materials from their site if you want to build your own.

{I was originally thinking of doing a thing on what [Evolvable Hardware](https://evolvablehardware.org/history.html) because I could go on forever about it, but I was worried it could be a bit too heady to cover in 5 minutes, but if you're into it, I would totally do rather do that instead of this one. Also, is that stuff common knowledge by now? Or is it just that I've told all the nerds I know so they've all heard about it.}

### The Jason Coob (Kevin #2)

[The L3D Cube 6x6x6](https://www.evilgeniuslabs.org/l3d-cube-6x6x6), which from here on will be referred to as The Jason Coob, by Jason Coon.

I think an LED cube was the first project I really lusted over the thought of doing, and still, a decade later, I haven't made one. Because the process of building them is kinda the most nightmarishly tedious pain in the ass project I can think of. You have to make a bunch of jigs and get a ton of joints bent and soldered just right or else the whole thing will look like garbage. And they're really an even more bespoke thing than Nixie Tube Clocks that you really can't just go out and buy for a non-ridiculous price.

Until some [Evil Genius (labs)](https://www.evilgeniuslabs.org/) made the process of building an LED cube not suck. The Jason Coob is a set of 36 of super thin strips of PCB with 6 surface mounted WS2812 addressable LEDs on each one, and they just plug into a base with a grid of 2x2 pin headers and a [Pixelblaze](https://electromage.com/pixelblaze) to do all the 3D math and control them. You can also get it with a frosty acrylic enclosure, which if you had just told me about that and I hadn't seen it in action, I'd probably say defeats the whole purpose of an LED cube. But no, it looks so sick with it on.

I like that it still keeps the spirit of LED cubes being a DIY thing that needs to be "earned" by building one yourself, but it takes it from a soul-draining week long slog of questioning every life decision that led up to this point, into a fun, couple hour relaxing project that ultimately ends in the same result, except with a much better-aligned grid.





### FlexPi Kickstarter (Paul #2)

The FlexPi is a new Raspberry Pi Pico with a few tricks up its sleeve.  First - it's flexible,
hence the name.  It also includes a few upgrades from the original Raspberry Pi Pico, including
using USB-C instead of Micro-USB and a programmable Neopixel built-in.  Otherwise, the pinout stays
the same as the popular Pico.

It currently has a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/top-diy/flexico-flexible-raspberry-pi-pico)
running through November 24th.  They've already reached their funding goal, having raised about $7000.
Remember, it is a Kickstarter and backing the project doesn't always guarantee delivery.

### EMMG MIDI Synth (Tod #2)

A hacker in our community, Johnathan Bisson / @bjonnh, created the
[EMMG Midi Synth](https://www.bjonnh.net/project/emmg_midi_synth_controller/) as
a teaching tool for a [Workshop on MIDI and music synthesis](https://github.com/bjonnh/2024_emmg_workshop_midi) at the
Pumping Station One hackerspace in Chicago
