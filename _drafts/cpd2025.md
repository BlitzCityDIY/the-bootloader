## Introduction - Welcome to CircuitPython Day 2025

### Fonts in CircuitPython

One of the really cool things about CircuitPython is how easy it is to get a display
working.  And the underlying `displayio` framework makes it not matter if you're using
a TFT, OLED, ePaper, or LED matrix: your display code can be the same for all.

Another cool thing about CircuitPython is how easy it is to use custom fonts. [CircuitPython can
load custom BDF & PCF fonts](https://learn.adafruit.com/custom-fonts-for-pyportal-circuitpython-display/overview),
a format used for 30+ years on Unix systems.  And there are tools to convert the more
modern TrueType or OpenType fonts to these formats. And a great Learn Guide!  But doing this
conversion can be kind of a drag.

So I was very excited when last year, Jeff Epler of Adafruit released the
["circuitpython-fonts" repository](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-fonts/).
This is a git repository with a large collection of converted fonts in a variety of useful sizes.

In this repo, each font is a laid out as separate python packages, with the whole repo being
an package bundle.  This means it's easy to add to the `circup` package management tool,
and that installing a new font onto your board is as easy as `circup install font_free_serif_bold_12`.
(This also means you can put your needed fonts in your project's `requirements.txt`)

### The CircuitPython extension for VS Code
Late last November, Will Merkens released version 0.2 of the CircuitPython extension for VS Code.  This is a fork of the original extension by Joe Devivo, which hadn’t been updated since late 2023.  A thank you to Joe Devivo for creating this extension and licensing it under the MIT license. That allowed Will Merkens to fork and a big shout-out for taking this on - it’s never easy to fok someone’s project, figure out someone else’s code, and then add to it.  And every time CircuitPython has had a major release, the extension has been updated.

If you bring up the Command Palette with Shift-Command (or Control)-P, and type `CircuitPython` you can see a list of commands you can run.  You can update the bundle, open or close the serial monitor, or as of the latest version of the extension, update libraries with some functionality inpsired by `circup`.  Listing libraries will show you what’s installed on your device; update all libraries will update them to the latest version similar to `circup update —all`, and show available libraries provides you with a drop down of every library available for download.

With the right board selected, you get code completion - for example, `board.` brings up all the available pins on the board.

You can interact with the serial console and drop down into a REPL if you want, or hit ctrl-c and ctrl-d like you’d expect.

### CircuitPython Workflows, what are they?

Did you know you can program CircuitPython devices FOUR different ways?

I'm sure you're aware of the one of the original differences between CircuitPython and Micropython:
CircuitPython only supported devices with native USB. This meant they could emulate a USB storage device
and provide us with the CIRCUITPY drive we normally use to save our "code.py" file on.  This restriction
was great though! With only a text editor and a terminal program, you could write CircuitPython programs.
Got an old Windows 95 laptop with Notepad.exe and Putty?  You can code on a CircuitPyton board. It's great.
(and in fact that's not too different from my normal setup of `tio` in a terminal window and `emacs` in another)

[show two terminal windows on-screen perhaps]

This native USB coding workflow was the original, but there are three others!  For ESP32 (non-S2/S3) devices,
there was the "Web workflow", where CircuitPython would start up entire web server with file transfer capability
and serial emulation. It's pretty amazing that it all happens in the background, but it does take CPU resources
that you might want, so I often have it turned off.

There's also a Bluetooth BLE workflow for nRF52-based devices, which is very cool, as it means you can write
CircuitPython code on your phone!  I've not tried it much.

Both of these wireless workflows can be frustrating if your reception isn't perfect.
So now this year, there's a "USB serial" workflow that works for any CircuitPython device that only has a serial
but not native USB, like the original ESP32 devices.  This is great!  If you've used Thonny with Micropython,
you're familiar with this kind of interaction. It's perfect for the new tiny "SparkleMotion" ESP32-based LED driver
boards that just came out.

I've not seen much talk about this new "USB serial" workflow in the docs, but it's really handy for these boards.
And thankfully, the web-based [code.circuitpython.org](code.circuitpython.org) site works with this and all the workflows.
