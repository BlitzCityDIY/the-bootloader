### CircuitPython Workflows, what are they?

Did you know you can program CircuitPython devices FOUR different ways?

I'm sure you're aware of the one of the original differences between CircuitPython and Micropython:
CircuitPython only supported devices with native USB. This meant they could emulate a USB storage device
and provide us with the CIRCUITPY drive we normally use to save our "code.py" file on.  This restriction
was great though! With only a text editor and a terminal program, you could write CircuitPython programs.
Got an old Windows 95 laptop with Notepad.exe and Putty?  You can code on a CircuitPyton board. It's great.
(and in fact that's not too different from my normal setup of `tio` in a terminal window and `emacs` in another)

This native USB coding workflow was the original, but there are three others!  For ESP32 (non-S2/S3) devices,
there was the "Web workflow", where CircuitPython would start up entire web server with file transfer capability
and serial emulation. It's pretty amazing that it all happens in the background, but it does take CPU resources
that you might want, so I often have it turned off.

There's also a Bluetooth BLE workflow for nRF52-based devices, which is very cool, as it means you can write
CircuitPython code on your phone!  I've not tried it much.

Both of these wireless workflows can be frustrating if your reception isn't perfect.
So now this year, there's a "USB serial" workflow that works for any CircuitPython device that only has a serial
but not native USB, like the original ESP32 devices.  This is great!  If you've used Thonny with Micropython,
you're familiar with this kind of interaction. It's perfect for the new tiny "SparkleMotion" ESP32-based LED driver
boards that just came out.

I've not seen much talk about this new "USB serial" workflow in the docs, but it's really handy for these boards.
And thankfully, the web-based [code.circuitpython.org](code.circuitpython.org) site works with this and all the workflows.
