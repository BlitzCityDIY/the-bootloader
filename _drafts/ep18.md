### Microcontrollers as computers (Paul #1)

### Slimedeck Zero

Microcontrollers are so powerful that we're starting to see almost full fledged computers being built.  A maker named
Abe Haskins has built a small handheld computer called the Slimedeck Zero using Pimoroni's PicoVision as it's brain. 
Abe has a [25 minute video up on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnwPmoWMGqk) that shows the entire process 
and parts used to build this tiny handheld computer that runs MicroPython, has an app launcher / operating system 
called `slime_os`, and is extensible with hardware plugins.

It features a keyboard he disassembled from a $9 remote control, a 5" 800x460 screen, and use the PicoVision from 
Pimoroni as its brains.  The PicoVision features two rp2040 chips, one acting as the CPU and the other as the GPU.

It also features an expansion port - Abe demos it by plugging in a XIAO microcontroller that's wired to an LED that 
the Slimedeck Zero can control.

#### Adafruit Fruit Jam

The second handheld is something Adafruit has been teasing for the last few weeks, which they’ve code 
named [Fruit Jam](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6200).   LadyAda was inspired from a recent Hackaday hackchat 
with Raspberry Pi’s Ebon Upton and built a credit card sized computer using the Rapsberry Pi 2350B chip, the one 
with the extra GPIO.

It includes a ton of peripherals such as DVI out, MicroSD, stereo headphone out, USB host with two USB-Type A ports, 
switches, Neopixels, and more.

We haven't seen much of the software running on it yet, but I have to guess we'll see CircuitPython running on it, 
giving us a full fledged CircuitPython mini-computer.

### 3D Printed Records (Paul #2)

Paul thought he found the perfect story for this episode, but there's a catch, which he shares at the end.
[Amanda Ghassaei](https://amandaghassaei.com/projects/) used a resin printer to create a 3D printed record.
