### 200 MHz Clock Support for RP2040 / Pico  (Tod #1)

Good news, everyone! Free speed boost for your Pico!
Raspberry Pi officially supports overclocking the Pico RP2040.
When the RP2040 was originally released, its Pico-SDK library configured the chip to run
at 125 MHz. This was incredibly fast! But still we wanted more. And it turns out the RP2040
was incredibly overclockable. People soon found that even doubling its clock to 250 MHz
worked great with no downsides. Many of my RP2040-based CircuitPython synth projects do
this to let me run at a higher-quality sample rate.

Overclocking is often frowned on by the manufacturer, and in desktop CPUs it can cause permanent damage.
Some venders of RP2040-based products were reluctant to sell something that depended on an overclocked RP2040. So when Raspberry Pi announced that 200 MHz was officially supported and [can be easily configured via a compile-time define](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/blob/master/src/rp2040/hardware_regs/include/hardware/platform_defs.h#L65), we all celebrated.

In both CircuitPython and the `arduino-pico` Arduino core for RP2040, changing CPU speed has always been pretty easy.  In CircuitPython, you can dynamically change the CPU speed by setting [`microcontroller.cpu.frequency`](https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/shared-bindings/microcontroller/index.html#microcontroller.Processor.frequency).  This can be useful for battery-powered applications, since power usage scales linearly with clock speed.  In Arduino, it's a simple compile-time directive available from the ["Tools"-> "CPU Speed" menu](https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ide.html#cpu-speed).

### Microcontrollers as computers (Paul #1)

### Slimedeck Zero

Microcontrollers are so powerful that we're starting to see almost full fledged computers being built.  A maker named
Abe Haskins has built a small handheld computer called the Slimedeck Zero using Pimoroni's PicoVision as it's brain.
Abe has a [25 minute video up on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnwPmoWMGqk) that shows the entire process
and parts used to build this tiny handheld computer that runs MicroPython, has an app launcher / operating system
called `slime_os`, and is extensible with hardware plugins.

It features a keyboard he disassembled from a $9 remote control, a 5" 800x460 screen, and use the PicoVision from
Pimoroni as its brains.  The PicoVision features two rp2040 chips, one acting as the CPU and the other as the GPU.

It also features an expansion port - Abe demos it by plugging in a XIAO microcontroller that's wired to an LED that
the Slimedeck Zero can control.

#### Adafruit Fruit Jam

The second handheld is something Adafruit has been teasing for the last few weeks, which they’ve code
named [Fruit Jam](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6200).   LadyAda was inspired from a recent Hackaday hackchat
with Raspberry Pi’s Ebon Upton and built a credit card sized computer using the Rapsberry Pi 2350B chip, the one
with the extra GPIO.

It includes a ton of peripherals such as DVI out, MicroSD, stereo headphone out, USB host with two USB-Type A ports,
switches, Neopixels, and more.

We haven't seen much of the software running on it yet, but I have to guess we'll see CircuitPython running on it,
giving us a full fledged CircuitPython mini-computer.

### ArduinoLibs bot on Mastodon/Bluesky (Tod #2)

We just did a CircuitPython Show episode on the CircuitPython Community Bundle.
In the Arduino world, the closest equivalent is the Arduino Library Manager's list
of libraries.  And one of the my favorite ways to observe updates to that list was the
"@arduinoLibs" Twitter bot that posted whenever libraries were added or updated.

With Twitter gone, thankfully the bot has moved to both Mastodon & Bluesky.
The @arduinoLibs bot appears to be tracking the pull-requests to the
[Arduino library registry github repo](https://github.com/arduino/library-registry)
and it's a great way to get ideas or see what people are doing with Arduino.
The bot is promises no more than six posts per hour so it doesn't overwhelm your feed.
I really like poking around libraries to see what's

Some examples:

- [YAMLDuino](https://github.com/tobozo/YAMLDuino) - YAML file parsing in Arduino
- [Usini Discord WebHook](https://github.com/usini/usini_discord_webhook) - Write Discord bots in Arduino
- [CodeCell](https://github.com/microbotsio/CodeCell) - Wrapper library for a new coin-sized ESP32-C3-based board that has a lipo-charger, 9-axis IMU, and light sensor

### 3D Printed Records (Paul #2)

Paul thought he found the perfect story for this episode, but there's a catch, which he shares at the end.
[Amanda Ghassaei](https://amandaghassaei.com/projects/) used a resin printer to create a 3D printed record.

On her Instructables page, Amanda shares how a record works and then walks through how she calculated the sampling
rate for a 3D printer including the smapling frequency, revolutions per second, and inches per revolution to get the
max sampling frequency of 12kHz.

She then used an Arduino sketch called Processing to take a sine wave and convert it to a series of integers which
could be converted to text, which she could create an STL file from. Amanda then printed 3 test records that played
back sine waves to test the depth of the grooves of the record.

From there, Amanda wrote a Python program to extract the audio data from a WAV file, which could then be imported
into the Processing sketch to create the STL file to be able to print the record.

The catch was that this article was from 2012! There were a few giveaways in the article.  When she compares the
resin printer, she mentions MakerBot and RepRap, which aren't popular printers today.  And her Python program uses
Python 2.5, which is ancient.  The comments ranged from just a few months ago to 12 years ago, and the YouTube videos
are about 6 years old. She was using a commercial Object Connex500 printer, and I'm curious
to know if in the last 10+ years how far resin printers have come to know if you could make an even better sounding
record today.

In more modern news, [The Guardian just published an article on February 25th](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/feb/25/vinyl-carver-lathe-cutters-home-cutting-records-craze)
also about creating your own records, but using a custom kit from Ulrich Sourisseau.  It’s a lathe cutting machine
that uses a diamond needle to cut a record one at a time in real time.  People in the UK are using them to create
custom pressings of say 20 to a 100 records that artists or bands can sell who might not be able to afford a regular
vinyl pressing.

The catch here?  Ulrich Sourisseau is a cash only operation, and if you want to buy one, you’ll need about
7000 pounds hand delivered to him in the Black Forest of Germany.
