### Microcontrollers as computers (Paul #1)

### Slimedeck Zero

Microcontrollers are so powerful that we're starting to see almost full fledged computers being built.  A maker named
Abe Haskins has built a small handheld computer called the Slimedeck Zero using Pimoroni's PicoVision as it's brain. 
Abe has a [25 minute video up on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnwPmoWMGqk) that shows the entire process 
and parts used to build this tiny handheld computer that runs MicroPython, has an app launcher / operating system 
called `slime_os`, and is extensible with hardware plugins.

It features a keyboard he disassembled from a $9 remote control, a 5" 800x460 screen, and use the PicoVision from 
Pimoroni as its brains.  The PicoVision features two rp2040 chips, one acting as the CPU and the other as the GPU.

It also features an expansion port - Abe demos it by plugging in a XIAO microcontroller that's wired to an LED that 
the Slimedeck Zero can control.

#### Adafruit Fruit Jam

The second handheld is something Adafruit has been teasing for the last few weeks, which they’ve code 
named [Fruit Jam](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6200).   LadyAda was inspired from a recent Hackaday hackchat 
with Raspberry Pi’s Ebon Upton and built a credit card sized computer using the Rapsberry Pi 2350B chip, the one 
with the extra GPIO.

It includes a ton of peripherals such as DVI out, MicroSD, stereo headphone out, USB host with two USB-Type A ports, 
switches, Neopixels, and more.

We haven't seen much of the software running on it yet, but I have to guess we'll see CircuitPython running on it, 
giving us a full fledged CircuitPython mini-computer.

### 3D Printed Records (Paul #2)

Paul thought he found the perfect story for this episode, but there's a catch, which he shares at the end.
[Amanda Ghassaei](https://amandaghassaei.com/projects/) used a resin printer to create a 3D printed record.

On her Instructables page, Amanda shares how a record works and then walks through how she calculated the sampling 
rate for a 3D printer including the smapling frequency, revolutions per second, and inches per revolution to get the 
max sampling frequency of 12kHz.

She then used an Arduino sketch called Processing to take a sine wave and convert it to a series of integers which 
could be converted to text, which she could create an STL file from. Amanda then printed 3 test records that played 
back sine waves to test the depth of the grooves of the record.  

From there, Amanda wrote a Python program to extract the audio data from a WAV file, which could then be imported 
into the Processing sketch to create the STL file to be able to print the record.

The catch was that this article was from 2012! There were a few giveaways in the article.  When she compares the 
resin printer, she mentions MakerBot and RepRap, which aren't popular printers today.  And her Python program uses 
Python 2.5, which is ancient.  The comments ranged from just a few months ago to 12 years ago, and the YouTube videos 
are about 6 years old. She was using a commercial Object Connex500 printer, and I'm curious 
to know if in the last 10+ years how far resin printers have come to know if you could make an even better sounding 
record today.

In more modern news, [The Guardian just published an article on February 25th](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/feb/25/vinyl-carver-lathe-cutters-home-cutting-records-craze) 
also about creating your own records, but using a custom kit from Ulrich Sourisseau.  It’s a lathe cutting machine 
that uses a diamond needle to cut a record one at a time in real time.  People in the UK are using them to create 
custom pressings of say 20 to a 100 records that artists or bands can sell who might not be able to afford a regular 
vinyl pressing. 

The catch here?  Ulrich Sourisseau is a cash only operation, and if you want to buy one, you’ll need about 
7000 pounds hand delivered to him in the Black Forest of Germany.
