### Sunsetting Mu (Paul #1)

Nicholas Tollervey and the developers of the [Mu code editor](https://codewith.mu) recently [shared that they will be sunsetting Mu](https://madewith.mu/mu/users/2024/12/10/retirement-plans.html). Mu has been around for over 9 years and is the first code editor for some people new to programming Python and MicroPython and CircuitPython.

The Mu team will have two releases in 2025. The first will be built with a few bug fixes and is considered a "legacy" release with libraries pinned to older versions so people using older hardware can still use Mu.  Soon after, the final versio of Mu will be released using the latest versions of libraries with the hope that Mu can live a few more years before becoming out of date.

The Mu team expects to have this done by the end of March, 2025.
