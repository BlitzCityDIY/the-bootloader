## Show Notes

### Tariffs are Bullshit (.com) - Paul #1
Thanks to Jason Coon of Evil Genius Labs, and inspired by an idea Carrie Sundra of Alpenglow had, Jason has launched a new website at [tariffsarebullshit.com](https://tariffsarebullshit.com).  The site is an opportunity to share emails, videos, and social media posts from manufacturers and suppliers explaining how tariffs are affecting their business.

If you have a story to news item to share, open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models) or [start a discussion](https://github.com/jasoncoon/tariffsarebullshit/discussions) in GitHub!

### Resurrecting Sinistar: A Cyber-Archaeology Documentary - Tod #2
[Resurrecting Sinistar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCuoUSDBVac) is a documentary
by nom-de-plume musician "Synamax" about the revolutionary (and scary as heck to me as a kid)
coin-op video game Sinistar.  Sinistar was created by Williams Electronics,
makers of other famous games like Defender, Robotron, and Joust.  It was the first
game to feature real-time sampled voice audio (*play Sinistar sample here*),
had a 49-way! joystick, and blistering fast gameplay. If you've never seen it,
gameplay is vaguely Asteroids-like, but you shoot the rocks to "mine" bombs used
against the growing sentient planet of Sinistar.

This documentary is quite long, at over two hours, but it goes the history
of the team that created these games, the challenges of making games in the 1980s,
some of the assembly language tricks needed for certain game features,
and the technical hurdles that made Sinistar unique.  It also discusses the
challenges of reconstructing a modern working build of the game from 40-year old source code.

This is because a couple of years ago, the [source code for several Williams' video
games](https://arcadeheroes.com/2021/04/14/source-code-for-several-williams-midway-arcade-titles-pop-up-online/) appeared anonymously online.

Along the way, the documentary has exclusive interviews with members of the Williams
game team: project lead and software engineer Noah Falstein, sound engineer Mike Metz,
and game designer John Newcomer.
