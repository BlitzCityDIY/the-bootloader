### SoundFonts, General MIDI and $50 MIDI "ROMpler" (Tod's #1)

We all know what MIDI is: a serial data protocol for transmitting musical performance
information.  Basically, digital sheet music. But worse than most sheet music, as MIDI
doesn't contain anyting describing what the notes should *sound* like.
It's just "play a G# on channel 1". A G# on what, a piano? a guitar? a timbale?

So in the 1990s, the [General MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_MIDI)
standard was created. Instruments that implementing it would always play a
"electic piano" sound when sent the "Program Change #2" message, an "Acoustic Bass"
sound when sent "Program Change #33", and "Seashore Effect" for Program Change #123.

But now we have another problem. Which electric piano? Which acoustic bass?
What the heck is "seashore effect"?
Different MIDI synths had different recreations for all these.
Some were really good, some sucked!  Around the same time, new PC sound
cards that implemented General MIDI also let you load "SoundFonts".
SoundFonts are a sound set of General MIDI sounds all in a single file.
And [many many SoundFonts]((https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts?formats=sf2&tags=soundfont))
have been created over the years. The most common SoundFont format ends
with the extension ".sf2", so if you see that file: SoundFont.

Okay now to the part I'm really interested in.  There's an open source
software synthesizer for Linux/MacOS/Windows called [FluidSynth](https://www.fluidsynth.org/)
that works really well and uses SoundFonts. It has APIs in C, Python,
Ruby, .Net and other langages.

Recently on the [Floyd Steinberg's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mr_floydst)
he demo'd a ["$50 ROMpler"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HWTC6XzUw8)
made from a Rasperry Pi Zero and an I2S DAC Hat,
running a small Python script he wrote that responds to MIDI and talks to FluidSynth.
The result is a little box smaller than a deck of cards and sounds as good
as MIDI synths from the early 2000s.

I'm currently building one as it's a great excuse to exercise my Python skills
somewhere other than CircuitPython.

And since SoundFonts are effectively just bundles of WAV files, I've been
experimenting with [`sf2extract`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/man1/sf2extract.1.html)
to pull those WAV files out and use them inside of CircuitPython!

### OpenSpool and SpoolEase - NFC Filament Readers (Paul #1)

[OpenSpool](https://github.com/spuder/OpenSpool) and [SpoolEase](https://github.com/yanshay/SpoolEase) are two open source
projects with a similar goal - to provide automatic filament detection for your 3D printer.  Bambu Labs filament, for example, includes
an NFC tag that allows Bambu Slicer or OrcaSlicer to get information about the filament that's been loaded, including the color,
temperature to print at, brand, and type of filmaent, such as PLA or PETG.  And with OpenSpool, it goes both ways - you can read Bambu
filament details for other 3D printers.

Both projects are similar where you'll need to buy some compenents, including an ESP32 for OpenSpool and and ESP32-S3 for SpoolEase,
along with an NFC reader and a few other miscellaneous parts.  Both projects have a complete bill of materials for you to bulid the project.
You build the NFC tag reader with those parts and 3D print the case  for it. OpenSpool does
[sell a kit on Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/spuder/openspool-mini/) with everything you need fully assembled for $66.00.

Once built, you can either create your own NFC tags and program each tag with your filament's settings, or use RFID enabled filament
from Creality and Bambu.  Just scan the RFID tag and your filament settings are automatically loaded in Bambu Slicer or OrcaSlicer.

OpenSpool's roadmap has future integration planned with OctoPrint, Prusa Connect, Klipper and Moonraker, and more.

### Andy's Pick #2: Another cool project
Andy shares something he finds cool.

### DIYR Design Lamps and Speaker (Tod's #2)

[DIYR (pronounced "dear")](https://diyr.dev/products/) is a website that showcases
high-design lamps, speakers, and fans that evoke the trendy minmialism of
Scandanavian designs from Ikea. But DIYR is different. The DIYR acryonym stands for
"Do It Yourself Revolution" and each product they show has detailed
instructions on how to build it. From the STL files needed,
which electrical components, to buy, and how to solder it together and screw it
all together.  The results look very professional and highly usable.

I particularly like ["BTN-M"](https://diyr.dev/collections/lights/desk-lights/),
a USB-C and battery-powered desk light that has an embedded capacitve touch switch.
The designs are highly modular so the "BTN-M" head can be mounted to a
["STR-HNG"](https://diyr.dev/instructions/STR-HNG-L) "structure, hinge" arm or a
["STR-WAL"](https://diyr.dev/instructions/STR-WAL-L) "structure, wall" wall mount.

DIYR.dev is a project from the [Design Friction Lab](https://designfrictionlab.com/).

### Podcast Later (Paul #2)

You may be familiar with read it later apps like Instapaper or Pocket.  These apps allow you to save an article on
the web to their service and read it later, with the ads and extra stuff you find on a website stripped off.  I've been
using Pocket for years and love it.

Michael Kennedy, a Python Software Fellow and host of the Talk Python to Me podcast, has created a new service called
[Podcast Later](https://podcastlater.com) that does something similar, except it creates a personal podcast for you
of the articles you save on the web. You download one of the open source bookmarklets and when you come across an
article you want to save, you just bookmark it.  Behind the scenes it uses a Text-to-Speech service and to convert it
and you have your choice of a male or female voice to read the article to you.  The service creates a private podcast
feed just for you that you subscribe to - meaning in work in *any* podcast app.  And if your podcast app supports
Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, you can even listen in the car.

Plans start at $6 / month for saving about 100 pages (25 per article) and 4 hours of playback a month.

*Disclaimer*: I am a former student of Michael Kennedy's Talk Python to Me training courses and Michael helped me
by answering some questions when I first was starting out podcasting.  Michael did not alert me to his new offering,
I came across it myself.
