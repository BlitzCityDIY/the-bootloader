### Synology Shoots Themselves in the Foot (Paul #1)
I'm lucky that I've had a few network attached storage devices over the years and two of my last three have been from Synology. I've also recommended them to a number of folks, but no longer as enshittification raises its ugly head once again.

Synology recently announced that to use one of their Plus series NASes it would also required a Synology branded hard drive to unlock all of the features.  And these just aren't optional features you might not care about, these are core features including hard drive health reports, lifespan analysis, and automatic firmware updates.

Synology doesn't make their own hard drives, they're rebadged Enterprise drives from the likes of Toshiba and Seagate.  And you pay extra for what those drives would normally cost, and I would assume that's due to Synology doing all kinds of product testing to make sure they're comapitible.  But now it feels like you're having to pay for that privilege twice, once in the cost of the NAS, and in the hard drives.  And when you're buying 8 hard drives for a large NAS, that cost adds up.

Synology has made some vague promises that 3rd party drives might be certified some time in the future, but claim that Synology branded drives paired with Synology systems are at less risk of drive failure.  But now you're going to pay a premium for that and not be able to buy some of the best drives on the market.
