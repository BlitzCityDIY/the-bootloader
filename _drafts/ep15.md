{Intro to Supercon here}

Supercon is now in it’s eighth year.  How long have you been going to Supercon?
* What’s the biggest thing that’s changed over that period?

Supercon is known for their conference badges.  I understand they did something a little different this year - tell me about it.

### About Supercon badges

Generally Supercon conference badges are PCBs with complex circuitry that is both visually
interesting and presents a sort of puzzle to the attendees. For some, the conference is an
entire weekend of hacking the badge: figuring it out and makig it do something cool.

Past badges have ranged from an FPGA that ran Linux, a 4-bit "retro" computer you programmed with switches, a virtual vectorscope, and a mesh networking chat keyboard.

Another aspect to badges has been add-ons, codified now into a sort of standard called "SAO"
-- simple add-on. It's a 6-pin connector that provides power, an I2C bus, and two pins of GPIO for whatever you want. Most add-ons just use power and light up in some cool way.

These SAO badge add-ons are pretty smalll: about 2" on a side.
And the size and format allows for easy exploration of PCB art.

So this year's badge was really just a holder, a platform, to show off SAOs.
It has six SAO sockets on the front and a PicoW and batteries on the back.
It also came with a small collection of starter SAOs to display immediately.

But the real fun came as people gave out and traded SAOs all during the conference.

### And your simple add on board was included for most attendees?  What was it?

[TouchwheelSAO](https://github.com/todbot/TouchwheelSAO) based off my [touchwheel0](https://github.com/todbot/TouchwheelSAO) board and my many other capacitive touch projects.

### Tod, what was your favorite project you saw at Supercon?

For me, the [Circuit Graver by Zach Friedlin](https://hackaday.io/project/197182-the-circuit-graver) ([post on Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2024/11/06/rapid-prototyping-pcbs-with-the-circuit-graver/))

Zach gave a talk on this, but on the DesignLab stage. Those videos aren't streamed immediately to Youtube. We'll have to wait for Hackaday to upload it. It's worth a watch!

The Circuit Graver is essentially a computer-controlled drag-knife that can cut through copper-clad boards.
The result is a lot like CNC milled PCBs, but it's *much* faster.
And the cutting bit is not wee little drill bit that snaps when you look at it wrong.

Zach is also a friend. I've been seeing him make crazy circuits with just carving copper boards for many years. It's neat to see him extend this to computer control.

### Paul, what was your favorite project you saw at Supercon?

### Favorite SAO(s) (Tod)?

  First, check out all the amazing [SAO contest submissions](https://hackaday.io/submissions/supercon-8-sao-contest/list) and this
  [hackaday.io SAO list by Dave Darko](https://hackaday.io/list/165860-simple-add-on-badges)

  The [winner of the Hackaday SAO contest](https://hackaday.com/2024/11/04/supercon-2024-badge-add-on-winners/) really won me over too.
  It's a full digital multimeter that looks like a tiny Fluke meter. It's got probes

### Favorite SAO(s) (Paul)?

A few of Paul’s favorites:
* Etch SAO (tiny Etch-a-sketch)
* SAO Digital Multimeter (Best overall) by Thomas Plummer
* Instant Arcade’s Pac-man SAO (ineligible due to using last years badge) (SMD challenge winner)
* Steven, a Simon clone - which uses Todbot’s SAO!
* Wish I could have seen:
  * Turntable SAO
  * Marvel X-Men SAO

### What was your favorite talk that people should be on the lookout for when the video is released?

[Chris Wilson recently shared](https://cdwilson.dev/articles/hackaday-supercon-2024/?utm_source=pocket_shared) about his first time to Supercon and included some tips for new folks. What advice would you have for a newcomer?
