### The RP2350 mini-computers are here (Paul #1)
Adafruit has been teasing us for months about their mini-computer, the [Fruit Jam](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6200), which they’ve been developing in the open even have a product page up for it.  It features the rp2350B, 16MB of Flash plus 8MB PSRAM, with the PSRAM helping for emulation, microSD card, DVI output, headphone output, 2 port USB host for keyboards, mice or gamepads, 3 switches, and more.  And if you’ve been following their development, they’re up to a Rev-D version that features a wifi co-processor, though I don’t see that on the product page.

But now a company named [Olimex](https://www.olimex.com) has beat them to the punch with a product that describes that doesn’t leave a lot to the imagination, calling it the [RP2350pc](https://www.olimex.com/Products/RaspberryPi/PICO/RP2350pc/open-source-hardware).  It too features the 2350b, 16MB of Flash + 8MB of PSRAM, but has 4 USB-A ports for USB-host, DVI/HDMI output, microSD card and stereo out AND in.  It’s only €25, which seems really reasonable.  It comes with a custom UF2 that looks to be running MicroPython and they market the Reload emulator for Apple II as well.  There is a short manual that mentions their UEXT connector of which they’ve developed some plug and play modules that use this universal extention connector.  They’ve also made the schematic and KiCad files available  on GitHub, which is a nice touch.  I looked at picking one up, but it was 23Euro to ship it, and that’s before any tarriffs.

### The return of the Commodore 64 (Paul #2)
[YouTuber Peri Fractic](https://www.youtube.com/@RetroRecipes), who runs an all things retro YouTube channel, has [announced on a video on his channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke-Ao-CpI7E) that after 7 months of negotiations, he has a deal in place to buy the Commodore 64 brand for 7 figures.  He’s created a public benefit corporation for Commodore 64, which means that while it’s not a non-profit, it has been founded to “preserve and promote retro-computing.”

And with that comes news that they’re selling a [Commodore 64 Ultimate](https://www.commodore.net) that you can pre-order now and is supposed to ship before the end of the year starting at $299.  They claim it’s the first new Commodore in over 30 years and that’s because it’s not doing software emulation, they’re using a FPGA to re-create the Commodore hardware.  There are [3 models](https://www.commodore.net/category/all-products), the BASIC Beige edition, a Starlight edition that adds a translucent case with sound reactive LEDs, and the Ultimate Founders Edition, of which there are only 6400 made for $500 and gold plated badges, gold keys, and more.

Each model has an HDMI port, built-in WiFi and USB to bring it into the modern era.   They’re able to play any of the original C64 games and the description even claims you’ll be able to plug in old cartridges, CRT TVs or even disk drives.
