### AlgoRave (Tod's #1)

My new favorite live music genre is "Algorave". While it's a term that's
been around since at least 2011, [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorave),
I just recently came across it.
Basically it's "live coding music to a live club audience". But wait.

You may think that watching nerds twiddling on laptops isn't quite "live music"
and you'd be right. I remember in the mid-2000s, I went to a few clubs
where people were playing [Monomes](https://monome.org/docs/grid/)
(those light-up gridded music controllers) on music stands, angled towards
the audience.  Seeing the pattern of lights on the Monome change as the player
interacted with it was much more engaging than just watching someone on a laptop
bopping their head. This is sort of what algorave performers do, because they'll
often project their live-coding screen onto the walls of the club. And these
live-coding environments look more like something out of a Hollywood executive's
idea of "hacking" is than the standard GUIs we're familiar with.

Picture a screen of text, semingly random sections of it flashing in time with the beat.
You see the performer's cursor move and scroll the text. The text changes,
the screen flashes, and the beat drops. Under and on top of the text are visual
representations of the notes, the drums, the audio waveforms being played,
making it difficult sometimes to make out the text, this code that is somehow
also a musical performance. But then it scrolls again, changes,
and the beat goes on. It's hypnotic.

This is live-coding. And there are many apps to try out!  Most are free and
open source. Several I mentioned back in [Bootloader Episode 2 back in Oct 2022](https://www.thebootloader.net/blog/2022/10/10/episode-2-m-is-for-makers-music-and-machine-learning/).

One I've been using a lot for the last several weeks.  It's called Strudel
and it runs in the browser.  And an artist I really like who currently
working primarily in Strudel who goes by "DJ_Dave".  I remember DJ_Dave
using Sonic Pi a few years ago (another live-coding app). Her live sets all
project her live-coding screen on the walls so it seems like you're *in* the
music.

Watch some Strudel videos on Youtube.  You can *see* the musical compositional
thinking happen in real-time.

### The RP2350 mini-computers are here (Paul #1)
Adafruit has been teasing us for months about their mini-computer, the [Fruit Jam](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6200), which they’ve been developing in the open even have a product page up for it.  It features the rp2350B, 16MB of Flash plus 8MB PSRAM, with the PSRAM helping for emulation, microSD card, DVI output, headphone output, 2 port USB host for keyboards, mice or gamepads, 3 switches, and more.  And if you’ve been following their development, they’re up to a Rev-D version that features a wifi co-processor, though I don’t see that on the product page.

But now a company named [Olimex](https://www.olimex.com) has beat them to the punch with a product that describes that doesn’t leave a lot to the imagination, calling it the [RP2350pc](https://www.olimex.com/Products/RaspberryPi/PICO/RP2350pc/open-source-hardware).  It too features the 2350b, 16MB of Flash + 8MB of PSRAM, but has 4 USB-A ports for USB-host, DVI/HDMI output, microSD card and stereo out AND in.  It’s only €25, which seems really reasonable.  It comes with a custom UF2 that looks to be running MicroPython and they market the Reload emulator for Apple II as well.  There is a short manual that mentions their UEXT connector of which they’ve developed some plug and play modules that use this universal extention connector.  They’ve also made the schematic and KiCad files available  on GitHub, which is a nice touch.  I looked at picking one up, but it was 23Euro to ship it, and that’s before any tarriffs.

### KiCad scriptability with kicad-cli (Tod #2)

Did you know you can use [KiCad from the command-line](https://docs.kicad.org/9.0/en/cli/cli.html)?
Let's talk about using KiCad("kee-cad") PCB software programmatically.

Until recently (like for the last 20 years), I used Eagle to design
circuit boards.  It was pretty great.  And it was made better back in 2011,
when the community, including Adafruit's Limor and PT, convinced them to change their
binary file format to a text-based one. This made integration with
version control systems like git much easier and a stable of tools to
process Eagle files blossomed, making our lives easier.

When I moved to KiCad last year, I was pleased to see KiCad also
had a well-defined text-based file format. And that script-based processing of
KiCad designs, both in the app and outside, was standard practice.
This enabled wonderful tools like various image importer & exporters,
[Stargirl's web-based Kicad viewer](https://kicanvas.org/),
[organic round trace generators](https://github.com/mitxela/kicad-round-tracks),
[manufacturer part number to KiCad footprint generators](https://github.com/uPesy/easyeda2kicad.py),
and exporters for popular PCB fabs.

But editing these files can be tricky, especially if they're currently open.
So I was really intrigued to learn about ["kicad-cli"](https://docs.kicad.org/9.0/en/cli/cli.html),
a command-line tool that ships with KiCad.  Using this tool you can do the
obvious things like export Gerber and drill files for PCB production.
You can also use it to programmatically import and export schematic symbols and PCB footprints.
But you can also have it run ERC (electrical rules check) and DRC (design rules check)
on your schematic and PCB on the command-line!
This is like a syntax and linter for code, but for circuit design.
It means you could add these to a github action, to ensure you
never check in a bad schematic. This is incredibly cool.

The reason why I started looking into it is I wanted to do a visual "git diff"
of a PCB design.  The normal "git diff" will show you how the text has
changed. This is great for code, but for a vector art design like a PCB,
not that helpful.  And the tools I found to do this were either part of
monthly for-pay services or had huge dependencies and written for old versions of KiCad.

So using some tips from a KiCad forum post, I made a
[visual diff simple shell script](https://gist.github.com/todbot/aa644de99d9dacf0307267ea03fdbc64)
that depends only on KiCad and a working web browser.
It works by calling "kicad-cli" and asking to render two different versions
of the PCB to SVG images and then some quick HTML CSS magic to animate a cross-fade
between the images. It's about 90% of what I want and with some changes to
my git config, I can now "git diff" PCBs visually.  It's not a tool I use
every day but it's handy!


### The return of the Commodore 64 (Paul #2)
[YouTuber Peri Fractic](https://www.youtube.com/@RetroRecipes), who runs an all things retro YouTube channel, has [announced on a video on his channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke-Ao-CpI7E) that after 7 months of negotiations, he has a deal in place to buy the Commodore 64 brand for 7 figures.  He’s created a public benefit corporation for Commodore 64, which means that while it’s not a non-profit, it has been founded to “preserve and promote retro-computing.”

And with that comes news that they’re selling a [Commodore 64 Ultimate](https://www.commodore.net) that you can pre-order now and is supposed to ship before the end of the year starting at $299.  They claim it’s the first new Commodore in over 30 years and that’s because it’s not doing software emulation, they’re using a FPGA to re-create the Commodore hardware.  There are [3 models](https://www.commodore.net/category/all-products), the BASIC Beige edition, a Starlight edition that adds a translucent case with sound reactive LEDs, and the Ultimate Founders Edition, of which there are only 6400 made for $500 and gold plated badges, gold keys, and more.

Each model has an HDMI port, built-in WiFi and USB to bring it into the modern era.   They’re able to play any of the original C64 games and the description even claims you’ll be able to plug in old cartridges, CRT TVs or even disk drives.
