### SAM2695 General MIDI chip (Tod #1)
- A full GM MIDI synth on a chip!
- Super embeddable in microcontroller projects
- very cheap!

### Rant about STM32 dev tools (Tod #2)

OMG you know what's worse than trying to use Arduino to write microcontroller code?
Trying to use Eclipse to write code!  What's worse than that?
Using a MCU vendor's wrapped version of Eclipse. And worse than that?
A vendor-skinned Eclipse that has sub-apps that run in an entirely differnet JVM to configure the chip with a GUI.
Worse than that? The only build for MacOS is Intel, so it runs in x86 Rosetta emulation.
Thus, a keystroke goes from Apple Silicon to emulated x86 to Java VM to Eclipse GUI to
vendor wrapper to finally your screen.
TO SAY IT'S "SLOW" IS TO BE KIND
On top of all of that, everyone in the STM32 world uses this dang GUI to configure the chips.
Sigh.  All this is to say: I've finally started working with STM32 chips.

I kind of blame Arduino for this situation.

Before Arduino, programming microcontrollers was a real pain: Windows only, using
proprietary IDEs written in Visual Basic invoking proprietary compilers, all costing
thousands of dollars. But around 1999, avr-gcc and avr-libc was created. A fully open-source
compiler suite for the very nice Atmel AVR microcontroller chips. Of course Atmel wanted
nothing to do with this, but everyone loved it.  And when Hernando Barrag√°n created
his "Wiring" thesis project in 2003 by smashing avr-gcc together with a hacked version
of the Processing IDE, the beginning of what we now know as Arduino was created:
a fully open-source cross-platform IDE for writing and debugging micrcontroller projects.
I used the Arduino IDE as a starting point for many projects and moving to a commandline-based
Makefile with avr-gcc was pretty painless, letting me use any more advanced code editor.

People bag on the Arduino IDE now, but it was revolutionary. It set the new
baseline for MCU development apps: based on GCC, Windows/Mac/Linux builds,
and the core compiler tools and libraries better be open source. And not trying
to lock you into the IDE.

MCU vendors of course wanted more features than the Arduino IDE could manage
so what to do? At that time, the Eclipse IDE was what VS Code is today:
a highly-extensible IDE that could take plugins and be reskinned.
Unlike VSCode, Eclipse was slow, bloated and terrible to look at, to me at least.
And the MCU vendors didn't help this with their often sloppy wrapping of Eclipse
in their own toolkits to "help" the user. It further obfuscated what I was
trying to do. Just give me a well-organized Makefile and decent standard library
with docs!

If you've done ESP32 or Raspberry Pi Pico development, you've experienced the
benefits Arduino started: good open standard libraries, good docs, GCC compiler,
immensely scriptable via Makefiles or CMake, very open source. All you need to
write code for these chips is a simple text editor and a terminal window.

And then we have STM32, the only MCU platform I've not delved into. Their chips
are great! I've been envious of my compatriots who have facility with them.
But their tooling!  It's like stepping back into the early 2000s with the bloated
proprietary IDEs, especially on MacOS currently.

Thankfully, under the hood, it's still all standard arm-gcc with a decent
set of libraries for the chips. But I can only find API docs in their crazy IDE, no
website, no PDFs. It's maddening. One "sub app" of the IDE is called STMCubeMX,
a code generator to help do proper chip configuration and startup.
This is useful. It "only" takes 15 seconds to start but just about every click
takes several seconds to register. The problem is since everyone uses it,
not many know how the code works it creates.
