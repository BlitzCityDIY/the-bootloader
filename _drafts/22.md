## Show Notes

### SAM2695 General MIDI chip (Tod #1)
- A full GM MIDI synth on a chip!
- Super embeddable in microcontroller projects
- very cheap!
- imlementations:
  - Seeed - https://www.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-MIDI-Synthesizer-p-6462.html
  - M5stack w/ speaker - https://shop.m5stack.com/products/midi-synthesizer-unit-sam2695
  - M5statck w/ MIDI in/out - https://shop.m5stack.com/products/midi-unit-with-din-connector-sam2695
- SAM2695 datahsheet - https://docs.dream.fr/pdf/Serie2000/SAM_Datasheets/SAM2695.pdf
- unfortunately "not recommended for new designs". what happens to the above products?

### Paul's Pick #1: Another cool project
Paul shares something he finds cool.

### Rant about STM32 dev tools (Tod #2)
OMG you know what's worse than trying to use Eclipse to write MCU code?
Using a MCU vendor's wrapped version of Eclipse. Worse than that?
One that has sub-apps that run in an entirely differnet JVM to configure the chip with a GUI.
Worse than that? The only build for MacOS is Intel, so on Apple Silicon Macs, you run
in Rosetta emulation.
So a keystroke goes from Apple Silicon to emulated x86 to Java VM to Eclipse GUI to
vendor wrapper to finally your screen.
TO SAY IT'S "SLOW" IS TO BE KIND
And on top of all of that, everyone in the STM32 world uses this dang GUI to configure the chip.
