### SAM2695 General MIDI chip (Tod #1)
- A full GM MIDI synth on a chip!
- Super embeddable in microcontroller projects
- very cheap!
- imlementations:
  - Seeed - https://www.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-MIDI-Synthesizer-p-6462.html
  - M5stack w/ speaker - https://shop.m5stack.com/products/midi-synthesizer-unit-sam2695

- unfortunately "not recommended for new designs". what happens to the above products?

### Supercollider Synth Engine and Supriya Python API (Paul #1)
The [Supercollider synth engine](https://supercollider.github.io/) has been around since 1996 and open sourced in 2002.  Supercollider includes there components: scsynth, a real time audio engine implemented as a server, sclang, an interpreted program language that acts as a client to the server that is similar to Smalltalk, and `scide`, an editor for sclang with an integrated help system. The server and client communicate using OSC - Open Sound Control.

I looked at some SuperCollider examples, but couldn't quite wrap my head around it.  Thankfully Andrew Clark wrote a Python API to Supercollider he calls calls [Supriya](https://github.com/dayunbao/supriya_demos). And he wrote a dozen examples and published them on GitHub.  They include an arpeggiator, an LFO, drum sequencers, and more. Then he takes it to the next level - he created a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/supriya/) where explains each demo, including an introduction to the concept, code for each demo, and then a walkthrough.

### Rant about STM32 dev tools (Tod #2)

OMG you know what's worse than trying to use Arduino to write microcontroller code?
Trying to use Eclipse to write code!  What's worse than that?
Using a MCU vendor's wrapped version of Eclipse. And worse than that?
A vendor-skinned Eclipse that has sub-apps that run in an entirely differnet JVM to configure the chip with a GUI.
Worse than that? The only build for MacOS is Intel, so it runs in x86 Rosetta emulation.
Thus, a keystroke goes from Apple Silicon to emulated x86 to Java VM to Eclipse GUI to
vendor wrapper to finally your screen.
TO SAY IT'S "SLOW" IS TO BE KIND
On top of all of that, everyone in the STM32 world uses this dang GUI to configure the chips.
Sigh.  All this is to say: I've finally started working with STM32 chips.

I kind of blame Arduino for this situation.

Before Arduino, programming microcontrollers was a real pain: Windows only, using
proprietary IDEs written in Visual Basic invoking proprietary compilers, all costing
thousands of dollars. But around 1999, avr-gcc and avr-libc was created. A fully open-source
compiler suite for the very nice Atmel AVR microcontroller chips. Of course Atmel wanted
nothing to do with this, but everyone loved it.  And when Hernando Barrag√°n created
his "Wiring" thesis project in 2003 by smashing avr-gcc together with a hacked version
of the Processing IDE, the beginning of what we now know as Arduino was created:
a fully open-source cross-platform IDE for writing and debugging micrcontroller projects.
I used the Arduino IDE as a starting point for many projects and moving to a commandline-based
Makefile with avr-gcc was pretty painless, letting me use any more advanced code editor.

People bag on the Arduino IDE now, but it was revolutionary. It set the new
baseline for MCU development apps: based on GCC, Windows/Mac/Linux builds,
and the core compiler tools and libraries better be open source. And not trying
to lock you into the IDE.

MCU vendors of course wanted more features than the Arduino IDE could manage
so what to do? At that time, the Eclipse IDE was what VS Code is today:
a highly-extensible IDE that could take plugins and be reskinned.
Unlike VSCode, Eclipse was slow, bloated and terrible to look at, to me at least.
And the MCU vendors didn't help this with their often sloppy wrapping of Eclipse
in their own toolkits to "help" the user. It further obfuscated what I was
trying to do. Just give me a well-organized Makefile and decent standard library
with docs!

If you've done ESP32 or Raspberry Pi Pico development, you've experienced the
benefits Arduino started: good open standard libraries, good docs, GCC compiler,
immensely scriptable via Makefiles or CMake, very open source. All you need to
write code for these chips is a simple text editor and a terminal window.

And then we have STM32, the only MCU platform I've not delved into. Their chips
are great! I've been envious of my compatriots who have facility with them.
But their tooling!  It's like stepping back into the early 2000s with the bloated
proprietary IDEs, especially on MacOS currently.

Thankfully, under the hood, it's still all standard arm-gcc with a decent
set of libraries for the chips. But I can only find API docs in their crazy IDE, no
website, no PDFs. It's maddening. One "sub app" of the IDE is called STMCubeMX,
a code generator to help do proper chip configuration and startup.
This is useful. It "only" takes 15 seconds to start but just about every click
takes several seconds to register. The problem is since everyone uses it,
not many know how the code works it creates.


### Why I love building things with microcontrollers; A love letter to embedded systems (Paul #2)
V. Hunter Adams, a professor at Cornell University, teaches (what I think) is a graduate level course on microprocessor based embedded controllers using an rp2040 and the Pico C SDK. [Hackaday shared a link](https://hackaday.com/2025/05/28/a-love-letter-to-embedded-systems-by-v-hunter-adams/) to his [November 2023 lecture, "Why I love building things with microcontrollers."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TFsfcIx04Q)

It's a full lecture, so it's a little long at about 37 minutes. He talks why it's important to build tings and have a project portfolio.  Building things is hard - nothing ever just works. He talks about simulation vs real world building and I wrote down this quote: *"It fills you with humility and wonder.  You will weep in aweo of things like keyboards".*

He then goes on to ask: What makes embedded system projects special? He talks about how engineering is the mechanism for him to learn other stuff.  He then goes off on a tangent about Leondardo DaVinci, who is a genius in multiple fields, but would study those fields for years in-depth.  He also talks about how microcontrollers offer constraints and constraints beget creativity.  And microcontrollers are just the right amount of complexity - for example a datasheet can be hudnreds of pages, which is compolex, but not behond the capacity of single person.

I've sometimes struggled to explain why I enjoy microcontrollers when asked about my hobbies, and I thought Hunter Adams summed it up nicely: They sit on the boundary between the natural world and the computational world and offer unique views of each.

### Tod's Pick #3: Some cool project

### Spintronics (Paul #3)
Thanks to Mastodon user GeekandDad, I came across[Spintronics](https://upperstory.com/en/spintronics/), which is a board game for players 8 and up to build mechanical circuits to solve puzzles. I love the description on their webpage: *Feel the pull of voltage and see the flow of current.  Electronics is abstract, but Spintronics makes circuit tangible, irresistbly touchable, and deeply intuitive.*

There are three parts available for purchase,  Act One is about $84 and introduces basic concepts including series and parallel, capacitor circuits, logic circuits, and more. Act Two introduces the transisitor and the inductor with intermediate and advanced concepts like amplifactiation, power conversion, feedback and oscillators.  You can get a bundle of those two for about $150 or add the Power Pack and get all three for about $180.
